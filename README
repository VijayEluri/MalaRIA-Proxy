This is a Proof-Of-Concept and thus the code quality is very poor.
Any help in approving it appreciated.

Current limitations:
- Does not properly handle encoding in all cases 
- Does not support binary data (images, documents etc.) - this is probably related to the encoding problem above
- The proxy runs the requests as a FIFO - not multithreaded
